# PowerQuadrantDemo
A script designed to provide an interactive, visual demonstration of the relationship between power, phase angle and
power factor. It uses a 4 Quadrant reference frame with a generator based signed convention as preferred by 
IEEE 1547 and IEC 61850-7-420 for distributed energy resources (DER).
